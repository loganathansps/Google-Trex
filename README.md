# Requirements:
	*Node MCU with Arduino IDE
	*Servo motor (SG90 or any)
	*Web cam 
	*Python 3 installed with Opencv

# Setup:
	*Recommended with two different computer system. One for the game were it is played, other for the opencv player. 
	Alternatively extended  separate screen shall be used to showcase the game screen. 
	
	*Upload the Arduino sketch to the NodeMCU, connect the servo motor, fix the servo motor suitably on the keyboard.
	
	*Connect the player system to the NOdeMCU's wifi. This is necessary to trigger the servo motor.
